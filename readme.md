# Pop!_Guide

Hey there. These are the Pop!_Guides that will take you on an exploratory journey inside your system. Neat, huh? From the very first steps as a system just being powered on, growing from an assembley infant to a monolithic multi-tasker! They grow up so fast!

The point of these guides is to be approachable, simply explained, and dare I say even a bit entertaining and aluring. Education is the process of getting to know a subject from technical point of views and never before has it been so important to inform and teach the general public about modern computing.

Please join me in an attempt to make a guide that could be printed in a childrens book! We're gonna make our own magic schoolbus, and it's going straight into your computer! Huzzah!

## !!WARNING!! Work in Progress

So the afformentioned text is just to show that we can be experimental in our approach to communicate something as cut and dry as documentation and guides. It might be a terrible idea, but hey: we've gotta progress somehow. Maybe that involves literary gamification, maybe something that involves an ***ETHICAL*** incentive systems... or maybe not. 

As it stands I have one "Beginners Guide" I'm working on. I spent some time hashing out what tools  I was supposed to use, what formats, dimensions, that kind of stuff. The method should also be easily replicated by any user, so I haven't set up any real pre or post-processing at all. Here's the list of apps I used:

- **Pop!_Shell** Have you tried taking consistant screenshots with a background image? It can get frustrating at times. Well, not anymore! `Super+Enter` allows me not only to align a window, but have it shaped according to the grid. 1:1 result every time (but can it dbus?)

- **Kazam** (Xorg) screen recorder, because it's fairly easy and gives those nice paddings you see around the terminal window where the background image comes through a little (TODO: change background image to something Pop!_OS'y) - can be used for videos, though we save on the data transfer by using delayed gifs instead.

- **GiMP** To basically shrink the canvas in height by 50% where the bottom half is not visible, create frame delays (1600ms, 5000ms, take your pick) and applying GIF optimization to save heaps of space on storage. Also since it's more of a landscape banner one could turn their handheld device into landscape mode to see what's what the gif is illustrating more clearly - dunno, the idea is still up in the air

- **Mark Text** Because it is a damn fine markdown editor. Live previews and you can export to HTML if one wants... to... import some js animation libraries.. or fiddle with the Pop React framework... I dunno... feel cute, might pandoc later

And that's about it. A simple list for simple folk like me. I fiddled with the idea of creating a VM machine specifically tasked at making screenshots of a bog standard Pop!_OS install and automating the window placement, background choice, as well as additional processing. Could be a cool way to auto-generate some screenshots for the Pop!_Shop, make it more vivrant... but *that* would be a long term project, if this thing gets any legs or if I'm just told to post to the forums untill the BRAND NEW Pop!_Planet comes into full force. 

In any case, I'm rambling. Check what I've got already.
